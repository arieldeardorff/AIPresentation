## Writing NIH Data Management and Sharing Plans

-   Writing data management plans can be time consuming
-   Both the format and contents are often unfamiliar
-   Can Versa write an NIH-compliant data management and sharing plan?
-   I entered a (very) brief overview of a clinical project
-   Shared that I wanted to use Vivli as my repository

## Everything Starts off fine

![](images/Plan1.png)

-   Had the basic format and sections mostly down
-   Some good language

## But then goes off the rails a bit

-   Second half doesn't match the recommended format 

## Better: Suggesting elements to include in a plan

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
Suggesting Repositories

Suggesting Standards

:::

## Bigger Challenge: Can AI help carry out the plan?
-   creating systems to manage data - suggesting tools and workflows?
-   preparing data for sharing - adding metadata, anonymizing data, etc
-   uploading data to a repository?
