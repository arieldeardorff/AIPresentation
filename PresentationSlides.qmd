## Can AI write NIH Data Management and Sharing Plans?

-   Writing data management plans can be time consuming
-   Both the format and content are often unfamiliar to researchers
-   Can Versa write an NIH-compliant data management and sharing plan?
-   I entered a (very) brief overview of a clinical project
-   Mentioned that I wanted to use Vivli as my repository

## Everything starts off fine

-   Had the basic format and sections mostly down
-   Some good language for the standards section

## But then goes off the rails a bit

-   Second half doesn't match the recommended format (although some of the content is good)

## What worked better: suggesting elements to include in a plan

## Suggesting repositories

## Suggesting standards

## Next steps: can AI help carry out the plan?

Some ideas:

-   Suggesting tools and workflows, validating forms and surveys based on what you said you would do
-   Preparing data for sharing - adding metadata, anonymizing data, etc
-   Uploading data to a repository 

## Questions?
